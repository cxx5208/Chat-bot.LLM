# LLM-Chat-bot

This project demonstrates a conversational retrieval chain for implementing a chatbot using large language models (LLM). The chatbot retrieves relevant information based on the conversation history and user queries to provide accurate and contextually appropriate answers.

## Features

- **Conversational Retrieval Chain**: Utilizes a map-reduce approach for retrieving and processing relevant information.
- **Integration with LLM**: Uses a large language model to generate responses.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Maintains chat history to provide context-aware responses.
- **Modular Architecture**: Allows for adding additional retrievers and compression features as needed.

## Project Structure

- `06_chat.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook demonstrating the implementation of the chatbot.
- `files/`: Directory containing supporting files for the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cxx5208/LLM-Chat-bot.git
    cd LLM-Chat-bot
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the `06_chat.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook 06_chat.ipynb
    ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to run the chatbot and see the conversational retrieval chain in action.

## Conceptual Overview

The diagram below illustrates the Conversational Retrieval Chain implemented in this project:

1. **Chat History**: Maintains the context of the conversation.
2. **Question**: User query is processed.
3. **Store**: Stores the conversation and relevant splits.
4. **Map-Reduce**: Processes the splits using a map-reduce approach.
5. **System Prompt**: Constructs the prompt for the LLM.
6. **LLM**: Generates the response based on the constructed prompt.
7. **Answer**: Provides the final answer to the user.

## Customization

You can enhance the chatbot by adding additional retrievers and compression features. This modular design allows for easy integration of new components to improve the performance and accuracy of the chatbot.
